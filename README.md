# VisuallyGraphic
A web application created using React that visually demonstrates graph traversal algorithms. 
* Graph Processing Algorithms: Includes various algorithms for finding paths between start and end nodes in a graph. Currently includes:
  1. [Djikstra's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) - a weighted graph traversal algorithm used to find the shortest path between nodes
  2. [Depth First Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search) - non-weighted graph traversal algorithm that does not gauruntee the shortest path
  3. [Breadth First Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) - a non-weighted graph traversal algorithm that gauruntees the shortest path
