# VisuallyGraphic
A web application created using React that visually demonstrates graph traversal algorithms. View the application [here](https://franksu1996.github.io/VisuallyGraphic/)
Currently includes:
* [Djikstra's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) - a weighted graph traversal algorithm used to find the shortest path between nodes
* [Depth First Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search) - non-weighted graph traversal algorithm that does not gauruntee the shortest path
* [Breadth First Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) - a non-weighted graph traversal algorithm that gauruntees the shortest path

* Known bugs: There is currently a small bug regarding wall placements and start/finish node placements. Sometimes, even when the left-mouse click is released, the onMouseUp() event listener is not firing properly. If this happens, simply click once anywhere. To avoid this, simply perform drag-and-drop operations slowly. Not sure why this is happening :(
