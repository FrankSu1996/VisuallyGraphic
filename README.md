# VisuallyGraphic
A web application created using React that visually demonstrates graph traversal algorithms. 
Currently includes:
*[Djikstra's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) - a weighted graph traversal algorithm used to find the shortest path between nodes
*[Depth First Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search) - non-weighted graph traversal algorithm that does not gauruntee the shortest path
*[Breadth First Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) - a non-weighted graph traversal algorithm that gauruntees the shortest path
